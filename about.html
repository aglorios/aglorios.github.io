            <p>Reframe Iran is a multi-platform documentary about contemporary Iranian art, artists, and the art market.
              <br>Our team has been funded by
              <a href="http://brown.columbia.edu/magic/reframe_iran">the Brown Institute for Media Innovation</a>
              by Columbia University and Stanford University from 2014-2015.<br>
              With this funding, we've been able to produce a Virtual Reality experience showcasing the studios of Iranian artists in the diaspora around the world.<br>
              We've also filmed a traditional documentary about the art market and three young Iranian artists competing in an art prize.<br>
              Please check back later for links to these projects and the rest of our work.</p>
